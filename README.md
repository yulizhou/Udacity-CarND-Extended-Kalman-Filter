# Extended Kalman Filter Project
This is the project that belongs to the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program. This project includes the EKF implementation to process generated Lidar and Radar data to estimate the state of a simulated vehicle.

Main code is to check out are: `src/FusionEKF.cpp`, `kalman_filter.cpp`, `tools.cpp`.

- uWebSocketIO 
- cmake >= 3.5
- make >= 4.1
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
